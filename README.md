# 🏮 Rasseki Game

Web-based 2D-game. More info will be added during development.

## 🤔 About development

I really don't know, what it will look like.  
But hope I will have fun during development.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Svelte
- SvelteKit
- Typescript
- AssemblyScript as engine base
- SCSS as CSS-preprocessor

## 🚀 Scripts

### Developing

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
